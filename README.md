# ML and NLP: Binary classification of text as containing Â±suicidal content by LR

### Background:
Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/qwqextra/redditdatasentimental). Although it contains 4 attributes, including sentimental encoding, I focused on the suicidal class label.

#### Current status:
 - Approx. ~88% accuracy with LR model - hyperparameters were tweaked with the goal of trading precision to improve sensitivity.
 - Current model demonstrates 90% sensitivity and 86% specificity in holdout testing.
 
#### To do:
 - [ ] Upload Jupyter notebook
 - [ ] Implement and test LSTM model
